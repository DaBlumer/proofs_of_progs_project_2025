\section{Question 6: except}

The \minline{except} function was implemented after the \minline{union} and
\minline{intersection} functions and is implemented with the formula
$$ A \setminus \{x\} = A \cap (]-\infty, x[~\cup~]x, \infty[) $$

This gives the following simple implementation:

The contract states exactly that some $x$ is in $\gamma($\minline{except e u}$)$ if
and only if it is in $\gamma($\minline{u}$)$ but is not equal to $e$.
