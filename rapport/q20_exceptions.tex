\section{Question 20 : bottom}

Since getting the empty set is a behaviour that is expected to happen at runtime,
type invariants and function contracts forbidding the empty set are not appropriate.

What is appropriate here is then to declare a Bottom exception, and make the
intersection operator (which is the only one susceptible to get an empty union) raise
this exception, ensuring in its contract that its result is the empty set if and only
if the exception is raised.
